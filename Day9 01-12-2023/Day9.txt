Set 
unorderd collection of unique elements
1.insertion order is not preserved (non-seq)
2.no duplicates
3.No index
4.Homo or Hetro
5.{}
6.we can change the value of Set - mutable

Set methods
1.add
2.remove  --> delete by value and throw error if element not present
3.discard  --> delete by value and doesnot throw error if element not present
4.pop-->  delete randomly
5.clear()-->delete all the elements 
6.copy()--> create another set
7.update()--> merge 2 sets

a={10,20}
a=set()

we convert from list to set , set to list , set to tuple.....
frozenset--> set which is immutable we have only copy method

Dictionary--> 
orderd collection of Homo/hetro key-value pair elments
values are stored under a key insteadof index
key cant be duplicate but it is CS
value can be anything (int float complex str bool list tuple set frozenset dict None)
value can be duplicate
if key is duplicate it will take latest value 
key can be int float complex str bool None tuple forzenset
(not allowed list set & dict cant be a key)
