Nested for loops in Python allow you to execute a set of code repeatedly within another set of code. Here's an example of a nested for loop:


for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
        print(f"Outer loop: {i}, Inner loop: {j}")

This code will produce the following output:

Outer loop: 0, Inner loop: 0
Outer loop: 0, Inner loop: 1
Outer loop: 1, Inner loop: 0
Outer loop: 1, Inner loop: 1
Outer loop: 2, Inner loop: 0
Outer loop: 2, Inner loop: 1
In this example, the outer loop runs three times (from 0 to 2), and 
for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs twice (from 0 to 1), 
resulting in six combinations of i and j values printed to the console.
