in  python we can assign a function to variable
in python we can accept a function as input argument in another function
they are called as Higher Order Function

in python there are 3 imp built in higher order functions
1. filter
2. map
3. sorted

filter
built-in function that allows you to filter elements from an iterable (such as a list, tuple, set...) based on a given function. It returns an iterator containing the elements that satisfy the condition specified by the function.
The filter() function takes two arguments:
A function that defines the filtering condition.
An iterable (e.g., a list) containing the elements to be filtered.

map
built-in function that allows you to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple..) and returns an iterator containing the results. It transforms each element of the iterable by applying the specified function.

The map() function takes two arguments:

A function that defines the transformation to be applied.
One or more iterables (e.g., lists) containing the elements to be transformed.
