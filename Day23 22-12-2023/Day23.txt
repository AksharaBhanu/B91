1. A class is a blueprint created using the `class` keyword.
2. An object is an instance of a class created by calling the constructor (which is usually named `__init__`).
3. The constructor method is spelled `__init__`, dunder method/magic method
4. `self` refers to the instance of the class and is used to access its attributes and methods.
5. Variables present in an object are called attributes or data members.
6. Functions defined within a class and accessed through objects are called methods or member functions.
7. Instance variables belong to an object and are accessed using `self` and the object's name.
8. Instance methods take `self` as their first argument and are called using the object's name.
9. Instance variables are used to store object-specific information.
10. To access and modify instance variables, you typically use instance methods.
11. Class variables belong to the class and are shared across all instances of the class. They are accessed using the class name.
12. Class methods are created using the `@classmethod` decorator, take `cls` as their first argument, and are called using the class name.
12b. Class method cant call instance method (can call both classmethod & staticmethod)
13. Class variables are used to store data shared among all instances of the class.
14. To access and modify class variables, you typically use class methods.
15. Every object has access to its respective class.
15a. Instance methods can access both instance variables and class variables.
15b. Instance methods can call both instance methods and class methods.


if the variable is storing personal info---instance var
if the variable is storing common info--> class var

if the method is accessing only class var--> class method

if the method is accessing only instance var--> instance method
if the method is accessing both instance & class var--> instance method

if the method is not accessing either instance or class var-->staticmethod

how to create a static method --> using @staticmethod decorator
static method --> do not take self/cls as argument
how do u call static method?
using class name (like class method)

types of methods in python class
instance method
class method
static method

Access/Visibility modifiers in python
1. public--can be accessed from anywhere		--> a=10
2. private--can be accessed with in respective class 	--> __b=20


process of binding data memeber with member function so that they behave as single unit --encapsulation
