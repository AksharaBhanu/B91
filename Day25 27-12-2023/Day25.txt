encapsulation
inheritance--> SLI MLI HI MPI HI
polymorphism-->greek --> poly many morphism--forms
2 types---> 
1 .Compile time (static)--method overloading-not supported
		what is method overloading
		2 or more methods having
		same name
		dif arg list

void m1(int i,int j)
{
 SOP(i+j)
}
void m1(float i,float j)
{
 SOP(i+j)
}
void m1(String i,String j)
{
 SOP(i+j)
}

		
2. runtime (dynamic)--> method overriding
   redefining the method in child class
   
   a. inheritance is mandatory
   b. method name should be same
   c. arg can be diff
   d. body can be diff


when do we override the method
when we want to change existing behaviour of the method
