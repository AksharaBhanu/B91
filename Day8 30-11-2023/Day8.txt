list
its a collection of data separated by comma with in []->[1,2,3]
it can be homogeneous or heterogeneous
it preserves insertion order -> ordered collection
list will allow duplicate
we can change the value of list - mutable
sequential data type - supports index (subscript)

Extracting required element from collection is called as slicing
to find the number of elements present in the list we can use len()
list index start from 0 to n-1  when n is the list size
it support -ve index -1 to -n (right to left)

list[startindex:endindex:step]

startindex is inclusive but not the endindex 
default step value is 1
slice step cannot be zero

list methods
1. append
2. insert
3. index
4. count
5. remove
6. pop
7. clear
8. reverse
8. sort
9. copy
10. extend

A. to check if the element is present in the list or not use 'in' ex: "API" in list1
   it returns boolean (True or False)

B. sorted -> #sort the content of list1 and store the result in list2 - list1 will not be modified

C. min -> return smallest number in the list/collection

D. max -> returns largest number in the list

E. sum -> returns sum of all the numbers present in the list

F. len

G. type

H. id

I. print

creating list
 using [] -----> *   comprehension
 using list()--> range() 


TUPLE
--read only list
-->its a collection of data separated by comma with in ()->(1,2,3)
it can be homogeneous or heterogeneous
it preserves insertion order -> ordered collection
tuple will allow duplicate
sequential data type - supports index (subscript)
we can't change the value of tuple - immutable


tuple methods
1. index
2. count

We can use
print , id , len ,min, max,sum,sorted, in

what are the diff b/w list & tuple

list				tuple
1.mutable			1. immutable
2.has 10 methods		2. 2 methods (index & count)
3.[]				3. ()
4.list()			4.tuple()
5.using *			5. no
6.list comprehension		6. no

SET
its a collection of data separated by comma with in {}->{1,2,3}
it can be homogeneous or heterogeneous
it will not preserves insertion order -> unordered collection
SET will NOT allow duplicate (one None is allowed)
we can change the value of Set - mutable
non-sequential data type - does not supports index (subscript)-->#'set' object is not subscriptable
